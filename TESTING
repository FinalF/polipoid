Manual regression test
======================
On Android v2.2 and latest, check the following:
* Start/stop polipo, check that the binary starts (using ps).
* Check the start on boot toggle works.
* Check the crash handler by killing the polipo wrapper/binary using the shell's kill command.
* Check settings interface is disabled iff there's no file manager installed.
* Select an over large file using settings interface, check the error message.
* Select a non valid settings file, check the error message.
* Check a valid settings file is uploaded.
* Check doesn't crash when a file is not selected (i.e. file manager opened, then back pressed).
* Check polipo uses user config if enabled (try toggle too). proxyName=changed, and http://localhost:8123/arst is a good test file.
* Try putting android into a low memory condition (using fill_mem), and check that polipo gets sent the reduce memory signal.
